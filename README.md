## Configuration

### Google Maps API Key Setup

The application includes automatic API key validation to help you troubleshoot configuration issues:

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key**:
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the **Maps Embed API** and **Geocoding API**
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Restrict the key to your domain for security

2. **Configure the API Key**:
   - Open `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json`
   - Add your API key:
   ```json
   {
     "GoogleMaps": {
       "ApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **API Key Status Messages**:
   - **"API key is valid"**: Everything is working correctly
   - **"API key is invalid or has insufficient permissions"**: Check your key and API enablement
   - **"No API key configured"**: Add your key to appsettings.json
   - **"API key not yet validated"**: Validation is in progress

The app automatically validates your API key on startup and shows helpful error messages if there are issues.
