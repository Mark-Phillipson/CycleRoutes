Subject: API Key Request for CycleRoutes Application Integration

Dear RideWithGPS API Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request an API key for integrating RideWithGPS functionality into my cycling application called "CycleRoutes."

## Application Overview

**Application Name**: CycleRoutes  
**Platform**: Cross-platform (.NET MAUI + Blazor)  
**Target Platforms**: Web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS  
**Developer**: Mark Phillipson  
**Email**: MPhillipson0@Gmail.com
**Organization**: MSP Systems  

## Project Description

CycleRoutes is a comprehensive cycling route management application built using .NET 9, Blazor, and MAUI. The application allows cyclists to:

- Plan and manage cycling routes
- Import/export GPX files
- View routes with interactive maps
- Track elevation profiles and route statistics
- Share routes with other cyclists

## Integration Goals

I would like to integrate with the RideWithGPS API to enhance our application with the following capabilities:

1. **Route Import**: Allow users to import routes from RideWithGPS organizations and clubs
2. **Organization Access**: Specifically interested in accessing routes from cycling clubs like the San Fairy Ann Cycling Club (Organization ID: 633)
3. **Route Data**: Retrieve route details including track points, course points, elevation data, and points of interest
4. **User Authentication**: Enable users to connect their RideWithGPS accounts for personalized access

## Technical Details

- **Development Framework**: .NET 9.0 with C#
- **API Usage**: RESTful JSON API consumption
- **Authentication**: Planning to implement OAuth (preferred) or Basic Auth
- **Expected Traffic**: Low to moderate (personal/club use initially)
- **Data Usage**: Read-only access to public route data primarily

## Intended Use Case

The primary use case is to allow cycling club members to easily access and import their club's route library into the CycleRoutes application for offline use, route planning, and enhanced navigation features. This integration would complement RideWithGPS by providing additional route analysis and management capabilities.

## Development Status

The core application is already developed and functional. I have completed research on your API documentation (https://github.com/ridewithgps/developers) and have prepared the integration architecture. I am ready to begin implementation once API access is granted.

## Compliance and Usage

I commit to:
- Following all RideWithGPS API terms of service and usage guidelines
- Implementing proper rate limiting and error handling
- Respecting user privacy and data protection requirements
- Providing proper attribution to RideWithGPS in the application
- Using the API responsibly and efficiently

## Additional Information

If you need any additional information about the application, technical specifications, or intended usage, I would be happy to provide further details. I am also available for a call or video meeting if that would be helpful.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and potentially becoming part of the RideWithGPS developer ecosystem.

Best regards,

Mark Phillipson
